# Posada BioInteractive Multimodal Music & Performance Lab  
### Research – Creation – Interactive Systems – Mixed & Performative Works

Welcome to the official repository of the **Posada BioInteractive Multimodal Music & Performance Lab**, a space dedicated to the intersection between **sound art**, **performance**, **interactive technologies**, **biosignals**, **MMHCI/BCI/DMI systems**, and composition for **mixed and augmented works**.

This repository contains materials developed Material developed in my research, in the Bachelor's degree in composition with electroacoustic media, Bachelor's degree in music and technology,
the specialization in contemporary composition with new technologies, the Master's degree in sound art, and the doctorate in compositionfor research project:

**“Design and Development of Hybrid MMHCI Systems with Biosignals and a Smartphone-Based DMI for Bio-Interactive Mixed and Performative Works.”**

It also includes artistic, technical and conceptual materials that reflect my broader work as a:

- Classical & flamenco guitarist  
- Contemporary and electroacoustic music composer  
- Designer of multimodal interactive systems with Smartphones, 
- Designer of  interactive systems for mixed media systems
- Developer of augmented instruments and bio-interactive performance works
