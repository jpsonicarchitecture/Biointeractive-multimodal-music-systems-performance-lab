# Sound Resources (snd)

This folder contains sound resources used by the Pure Data modules of this repository.

Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the complete collection of audio files
(samples, sound banks, and auxiliary audio resources) is hosted externally
and must be downloaded separately.

## External Download

The complete **snd** folder is available at the following Google Drive link:

[Download sound resources (snd) from Google Drive]
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RpAVxsPJUrTBI_TDrNU7Iy-VIKn34j16?usp=drive_link)]

After downloading, place the **snd** folder inside the corresponding module
directory, preserving the original folder structure.

## Usage Notes
- These sound files are required for the correct execution of the patches.
- Do not rename files or folders, as they are referenced internally by the patches.
- The modules will not function correctly if the **snd** folder is missing or incomplete.

## Compatibility
- Designed for use with Pure Data / Purr Data version 2.19 or higher.
- Compatible with all modules referencing external sound resources.
