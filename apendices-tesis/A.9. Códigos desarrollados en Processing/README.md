# A.9. Processing Codes

This section contains the **Processing codes** developed as complementary modules for the **reception, visualization, and analysis of smartphone motion data** within the multimodal human–machine interaction systems (MMHCI) used throughout the research and artistic works presented in this doctoral thesis.

The sketches included here allow the interpretation of data obtained from the **inertial sensors of mobile devices**, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and rotation vector, enabling a spatial and temporal understanding of smartphone movement in real time.

These modules were conceived as **experimental and pedagogical support tools**, intended to:
- Verify the correct operation of smartphone sensors.
- Analyze the dynamic behavior of the device.
- Serve as a foundation for mapping gestural parameters to sound and interaction processes.

## Included sensors and modules

The Processing codes in this section cover the following sensors and motion models:

### Accelerometer
- Reading of acceleration data on the X, Y, and Z axes.
- Analysis of displacement, impacts, and orientation changes.
- Use as triggers and modulators for sound events.

### Gyroscope
- Reception of angular rotation data.
- Identification of rotational gestures and orientation variations.
- Complementary data source for motion stability and correction.

### Rotation Vector
- Unified representation of device orientation.
- 2D and 3
