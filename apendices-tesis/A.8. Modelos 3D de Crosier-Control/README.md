# A.8 3D Models of Crosier-Control

This section contains the three-dimensional models of the Crosier-Control DMI
(Digital Musical Instrument), including design files, structural models, and
assembly documentation.

The materials provided here are intended for fabrication, analysis, and
reconstruction of the Crosier-Control instrument as developed within the
Biointeractive Multimodal Music Systems Performance Lab.

## Contents

### A.8.1 Fusion 360 f3D Files for 3D Printing Models
This subsection includes the original **f3D design files** created in
Autodesk Fusion 360, corresponding to the 3D-printable components of the
Crosier-Control model.

### A.8.2 Structural Models of the Crosier-Control DMI
This subsection contains the structural and mechanical models of the
Crosier-Control instrument, detailing its internal architecture and physical
organization.

### A.8.3 Assembly Instructions
This subsection provides documentation and guidelines for the physical
assembly of the Crosier-Control model, including component placement,
mechanical relationships, and structural integration.

## Requirements
- Autodesk Fusion 360 (or compatible CAD software)
- Access to 3D printing or digital fabrication tools
- Basic knowledge of mechanical assembly

## Usage Notes
- The f3D files are provided for academic and research purposes.
- Modifications should preserve the structural integrity of the instrument.
- Assembly instructions should be followed to ensure correct physical behavior
  and sensor placement.
